      "Narrative": "Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Use the key from the dog and open the brig door. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. Nautical Flags: Look up the order of the flags for the direction and count for the directional lock, which is RIght 4, Left 1, Up 6, Right 3, Left 2. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. ",

      "Narrative": "Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. Pull down the sail and sail the ship to the 3 islands - Cartegena (lower left),  Port Royale (Center, upper left), and San Juan (far right). \n\nThe first two islands yield the audio \"AHOY\". The third island yields \"shiver me timbers\" and opens the trunk and ends the game. ",

      "Narrative": "Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number coins of each type to get a 3 digit code. 7 gold, 6 black, and 4 silver. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Use the key from the dog and open the brig door. Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. ",

      "Narrative": "Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Nautical Flags: Look up the order of the flags for the direction and count for the directional lock, which is RIght 4, Left 1, Up 6, Right 3, Left 2. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. ",

      "Narrative": "Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Use the key from the dog and open the brig door. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. Pull down the sail and sail the ship to the 3 islands - Cartegena (lower left),  Port Royale (Center, upper left), and San Juan (far right). \n\nThe first two islands yield the audio \"AHOY\". The third island yields \"shiver me timbers\" and opens the trunk and ends the game. ",

      "Narrative": "Assemble 15 pieces into a map. Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. ",

      "Narrative": "Use the key from the dog and open the brig door. Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number coins of each type to get a 3 digit code. 7 gold, 6 black, and 4 silver. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. ",

      "Narrative": "Use the key from the dog and open the brig door. Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). ",

      "Narrative": "Use the key from the dog and open the brig door. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. ",

Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number coins of each type to get a 3 digit code. 7 gold, 6 black, and 4 silver. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

      "Narrative": "Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Use the key from the dog and open the brig door. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number coins of each type to get a 3 digit code. 7 gold, 6 black, and 4 silver. Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. ",

Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. Nautical Flags: Look up the order of the flags for the direction and count for the directional lock, which is RIght 4, Left 1, Up 6, Right 3, Left 2. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Pull down the sail and sail the ship to the 3 islands - Cartegena (lower left),  Port Royale (Center, upper left), and San Juan (far right). \n\nThe first two islands yield the audio \"AHOY\". The third island yields \"shiver me timbers\" and opens the trunk and ends the game. ",

On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number coins of each type to get a 3 digit code. 7 gold, 6 black, and 4 silver. Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. ",

      "Narrative": "Use the fishing pole to get the key from the dog. Use the key from the dog and open the brig door. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number coins of each type to get a 3 digit code. 7 gold, 6 black, and 4 silver. Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. ",

There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Knot clock has knots corresponding to time. Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. Nautical Flags: Look up the order of the flags for the direction and count for the directional lock, which is RIght 4, Left 1, Up 6, Right 3, Left 2. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. Pull down the sail and sail the ship to the 3 islands - Cartegena (lower left),  Port Royale (Center, upper left), and San Juan (far right). \n\nThe first two islands yield the audio \"AHOY\". The third island yields \"shiver me timbers\" and opens the trunk and ends the game. ",

There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. ",

On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

Pull down the sail and sail the ship to the 3 islands - Cartegena (lower left),  Port Royale (Center, upper left), and San Juan (far right). \n\nThe first two islands yield the audio \"AHOY\". The third island yields \"shiver me timbers\" and opens the trunk and ends the game. ",

On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

Nautical Flags: Look up the order of the flags for the direction and count for the directional lock, which is RIght 4, Left 1, Up 6, Right 3, Left 2. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.

On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map. Pull down the sail and sail the ship to the 3 islands - Cartegena (lower left),  Port Royale (Center, upper left), and San Juan (far right). \n\nThe first two islands yield the audio \"AHOY\". The third island yields \"shiver me timbers\" and opens the trunk and ends the game. ",

Knots are shown in the back of the wine holder. 4x3 grid of circles shows which ones to do in which order. The positions on the clock correspond to the hours on the clock - you get 5817. Nautical Flags: Look up the order of the flags for the direction and count for the directional lock, which is RIght 4, Left 1, Up 6, Right 3, Left 2. Solve the crossword puzzle, turn it sideways, compare to chart on wall, it shows SALT. SALT opens word lock on small gray box. Look in the small wooden cube for the shape of four islands. Refer to the islands on the wall in that order:\nAntigua 8\nBarbados 7\nJamaica 9\nTrinidad 4\n Opens black lock on box with studs. THe cypher wheel requires you to set up the cyphers like this:\nFor the first word, Cyphers should be ordered \nC (arrow on 4)\nB (arrow on 5)\nA (arrow on 8)\nThen the combinations are C6 (look at A), Cn (look at B) CV (Look at B), C7 (Look at B), CY (Look at A) - CROSS\n\nFOr the second one, place the gears:\nA (arrow on 7)\nC (arrow on 5)\nB (arrow on 3)\nB6->C, Bk->C, BA->A, BJ->C, B8->A (BONES)\n\nThe two word locks on the half barrel are CROSS and BONES. Once you've opened the porthole door, press the letters in order SHIPWRECK. THis opens the last door. On the captain's desk is a wooden box with 3 coins and jewels.Using the coins found in a previous chest, count the number of jewels on specific coins gold black, silver in order that is on the box. There are 4, 3 and 1 jewels. Use the bellows found earlier to blow the sand away from the sand puzzle to reveal 24 R (HearT). Set the wheel so that the 24, R, and (heart) line up. Then the bottom of the jeweled box shows symbols which correspond to B T X and 8-26-4. Use this to open the desk drawer with BTX using combination 8-26-4 on the lock. Assemble 15 pieces into a map.
